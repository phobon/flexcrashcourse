# Flexible box (flex) layout

Flex is a **container-based** layout. Flex can control various aspects of elements within a particular container. It's really good at:

#### Direction
Elements are arranged on a single plane (vertical or horizontal)

#### Alignment
Flex is awesome at controlling alignment - easily centre things

#### Sizing
Elements can be sized to content, fill all available space or part thereof

#### Order
Elements render in the order declared, or any other order you specify
