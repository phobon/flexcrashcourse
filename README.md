# Flex Crash Course
A crash course in flex using Next, styled-components and styled-system. The idea here is to create a little playground to demonstrate some of the things that flex was made for, what it's really good at and some shortcuts to get a lot of power without needing to know a lot

## Demo
A demo for this project can be found: [https://flexcrashcourse-rgjosuydyc.now.sh/]

## How to install
This is a project built using NextJs (static website builder for React), so there are only a few steps to build and run it. npm or yarn can be used interchangably:

````
1. Clone repo
2. yarn install
3. next or yarn run dev
````
